Space Challenge
In this project, you will build a simulation that will help us with our mission 
    to Mars!

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and 
    rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the 
    correct fleet of rockets.

We've already designed 2 rocket prototypes, but we need your help to design and 
    run some simulations to help us decide which type to use.
